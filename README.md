# Assignment3
Part 1 – Computing Values – 40 points
E4.5 modified
Write a program that prompts for and reads a set of floating-point values in a sentinel-controlled loop; use the value 0 to terminate the loop.  Ask the user to enter the values and then print:
•	The average of the values
•	The smallest of the values
•	The largest of the values
•	The range of the values, which is the difference between the largest and smallest

Part 2 – Computing Volumes and Surface Areas – 50 points
E5.11
Write functions:
•	double sphere_volume(double r)
•	double sphere_surface(double r)
•	double cylinder_volume(double r, double h)
•	double cylinder_surface(double r, double h)
•	double cone_volume(double r, double h)
•	double cone_surface(double r, double h)
that compute the volume and surface area of a sphere with radius r, a cylinder with a circular base with radius r and height h, and a cone with a circular base with radius r and height h.  Then, write a program that prompts the user for the values of r and h, calls the six functions, and prints the results.

Part 3 – Comparing Arrays – 70 points
E6.8 modified
Write a function
bool equals(int a[], int a_size, int b[], int b_size)
that checks whether two arrays have the same elements in the same order.  Write a main function that tests this code.

Part 4 – Computing Distance and Midpoint – 90 points
E7.16 and E7.17 modified
Define a structure Point.  A point has an x- and y-coordinate.  Write a function
double distance(Point a, Point b)
that computes the distance from a to b.  Write another function
Point midpoint(Point a, Point b)
that computes the point that is halfway between a and b.  Write a program that inputs the coordinates of two points, computes the distance between them, displays the result, computes the midpoint between them, and displays the result.
